## Google Maps SDK for Android

This repo is to explore the Google Maps SDK for Android by trying it out in an Android App powered by `Kotlin`.

>[!Note]
>For the app to build successfully, replace the `<YOUR_MAPS_API_KEY>` placeholder in [`AndroidManifest.xml`](https://github.com/Ashrockzzz2003/google_maps_kotlin_android/blob/main/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) with your Google Maps API Key.
